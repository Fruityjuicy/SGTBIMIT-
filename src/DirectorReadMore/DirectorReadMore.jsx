        <p>We at Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Institute of Management & Information Technology endeavor to follow Gurbani in letter and spirit. The management and staff of SGTBIMIT work on a mission and treat students with utmost love & compassion.SGTBIMIT started in the year 2009 with a modest strength and in the next couple of years, it has crossed the 1500 mark. At present, it has emerged as a premier institution that stands above most of the institutes of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University.We are happy to have a qualified, dedicated, innovative, and hard-working faculty as well as administrative staff. Besides our best Computer Laboratories, our Library, Sports Complex, Canteen, etc are also best equipped. We have a separate Girls Cultural Complex for their better growth. Our classrooms are fully Air- Conditioned with provisions of Audio Visual instructions. Our placement mechanism is one of the best among all the institutes affiliated to Guru Gobind Singh I.P. University. We impart knowledge – continuously upgraded – keeping in mind contemporary industrial culture and requirements.We have been able to achieve all this with the continuous guidance and support from S. Harmeet Singh Kalka Ji   (President, DSGMC), S. Jagdip Singh Kahlon (General Secretary, DSGMC), S. M.P.S. Chadha Ji (Chairman, SGTBIMIT) and S. Jasbir Singh Jassi Ji (Co-Chairman, SGTBIMIT). We remain indebted to them for all-round growth of our Institute. I feel immensely happy and want to Congratulate everyone for the increase in the intake of seats in our second shift for BBA(G) and BCA courses.We endeavor to make our students competitive and grow with human values as envisaged in our Gurbani.</p>
