        <h2>“Art speaks where words are unable to explain”</h2>
        <p> <b> "Fine art is that in which the hand, the head, and the heart of man go together...."</b> <br /> The arts enhance the process of learning. The fine arts also provide learners with non-academic benefits such as promoting self-esteem, motivation, aesthetic awareness, cultural exposure, creativity, improved emotional expression, as well as social harmony and appreciation of diversity. Various events like poster-making competitions, rangoli, drawing, interactive digital media, painting competitions, photography, etc. are being organized by the Society.</p>
