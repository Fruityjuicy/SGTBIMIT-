        <p>The institute has a vibrant Cultural Society that provides a platform for students for displaying their creativity and talents. Different societies function under the aegis of the cultural committees - music, dramatics, fine arts, photography, and debating are some of them. The activities of the cultural committee are largely student-driven and under the guidance of faculty members.

          These societies practice and perform throughout the year. These societies have their individual executive bodies. They also induct new members through auditions at the beginning of the academic year. Besides giving platforms to students for honing their talents and skills, the societies also organize their respective annual festivals. The highlight of the cultural committee's activities is "Anugoonj", the much-awaited annual cultural festival of IPU.</p>
