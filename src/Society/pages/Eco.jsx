        <p>We know that we are an integral part of the environment we live in and the solution to many environmental problems lies in our attitude towards the environment. The best way to bring about a change in this attitude in society is through students. Here comes the role of Eco Clubs which plays a very important role in creating environmental awareness amongst the future generation. It is a platform on which we get the knowledge about the environment and offers programs and activities to encourage others to reduce pollution, and plant new trees. In our institute we have an eco-club, which performs activities to save the environment, like planting trees, organizing poster competitions, rangoli competitions on various environmental issues.  New saplings are planted and the damaged/ rotten plants are replaced with fresh healthy ones to keep the campus and surroundings green. 

        The activities under the scheme include:

        1. Motivate the students to keep their surroundings green and clean by undertaking plantations of trees.

        2. Promote the ethos of conservation of water by minimizing the use of water.

        3. Motivate students to imbibe habits and life style for minimum waste generation, source separation of waste, and disposing of the waste to the nearest storage point.

        4. Educate students to create awareness among public and sanitary workers, so as to stop the indiscriminate burning of waste that causes respiratory diseases.

        5. Sensitize the students to minimize the use of plastic bags, not to throw them in public places as they choke drains and sewers, cause water logging and provide a breeding ground for mosquitoes.

        6. Organize tree plantation programmes, awareness programmes such as Quiz, essay, painting competitions, rallies, nukkad natak etc. regarding various environmental issues and educate children about re-use of waste material & preparation of products out of waste.</p>
